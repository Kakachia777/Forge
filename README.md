  <p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 20px;">🎨 Sophia: The Next-Generation Design Creation Platform 🌐</p>
</div>
<p>Introducing Sophia, the most technologically advanced design creation platform that harnesses the power of cutting-edge AI, machine learning, and cloud computing to revolutionize the way you create stunning designs for AR/VR, 3D, App Design, Web Design, Illustrations, and UX/UI Design.</p>
<h2>🌟 Cutting-Edge Technologies</h2>
<p>Forge leverages the following state-of-the-art technologies and tools:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Language Models:</strong> Forge utilizes the powerful Gemini Pro 1.5 and GPT-4 Turbo language models to understand and generate human-like text. These models are fine-tuned on a vast corpus of design-related literature, enabling Forge to comprehend and interpret design requirements expressed in natural language.</li>
  <li><strong>Stable Diffusion:</strong> We employ Stable Diffusion, a state-of-the-art latent diffusion model, to generate high-quality images and designs from textual descriptions. Stable Diffusion is trained on the extensive LAION-5B dataset, which encompasses a wide range of visual concepts and styles, allowing Forge to create diverse and visually appealing designs.</li>
  <li><strong>ControlNet:</strong> Forge integrates ControlNet, a neural network architecture that enables fine-grained control over the generated designs. ControlNet allows users to specify spatial and semantic constraints, such as object positions, sizes, and relationships, ensuring that the generated designs adhere to specific layout and composition requirements.</li>
  <li><strong>3D Generative Models:</strong> For 3D design tasks, Forge utilizes advanced 3D generative models like Point-E and DreamFusion. These models are trained on extensive 3D datasets, such as ShapeNet and ABC Dataset, enabling the generation of high-quality 3D models and scenes from textual descriptions or 2D images.</li>
  <li><strong>Figma API:</strong> Forge seamlessly integrates with the Figma API, allowing users to import and export designs directly from Figma. This integration enables designers to leverage Figma's powerful design tools and collaborate with their existing workflows.</li>
  <li><strong>Hugging Face Diffusers:</strong> We utilize the Hugging Face Diffusers library to efficiently deploy and run the generative models in a scalable manner. Diffusers provide a unified interface for various generative models, making it easy to experiment with different architectures and fine-tune them for specific design tasks.</li>
  <li><strong>PyTorch:</strong> Forge is built on PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework known for its flexibility and ease of use. PyTorch enables the development and training of custom neural network architectures and provides a rich ecosystem of pre-trained models and extensions.</li>
  <li><strong>FastAPI:</strong> The backend of Forge is powered by FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. FastAPI allows for the creation of scalable and asynchronous APIs, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend components.</li>
</ul>
<h2>🎓 Datasets and Fine-Tuning</h2>
<p>Forge leverages an extensive collection of datasets to fine-tune its models for specific design tasks:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Behance Dataset:</strong> We utilize the Behance Dataset, which contains millions of design projects across various domains, including web design, graphic design, and illustration. This dataset is used to fine-tune our generative models, enabling them to understand and generate designs that align with contemporary design trends and styles.</li>
  <li><strong>UX/UI Design Datasets:</strong> Forge incorporates specialized datasets focused on UX/UI design, such as the Rico Dataset and the Mobile App Design Dataset. These datasets contain a vast collection of mobile app screenshots and UI components, allowing Forge to generate intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces.</li>
  <li><strong>3D Model Datasets:</strong> For 3D design tasks, we leverage comprehensive 3D model datasets like ShapeNet, ABC Dataset, and PartNet. These datasets encompass a wide variety of 3D objects and scenes, enabling Forge to generate realistic and detailed 3D designs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>🚀 Getting Started</h2>
<p>To get started with Forge, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
